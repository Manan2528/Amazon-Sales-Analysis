# 🛒 Amazon Sales Data Analysis

## 🔍 Project Overview
Amazon is one of the largest online shopping platforms, generating massive amounts of sales data every day. However, raw data alone isn't enough — it must be analyzed to extract valuable business insights. This project explores Amazon's sales data to identify top-selling products, sales trends over time, high-performing months, and revenue patterns. The aim is to help businesses make smarter decisions, improve their marketing strategies, and better understand customer behavior.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Although Amazon collects a large amount of sales data, simply storing this data isn't enough to support decision-making. By analyzing the data using Python and visual tools, we can uncover useful patterns such as best-selling products, seasonal trends, and revenue performance. These insights help businesses boost sales, optimize inventory, and refine marketing efforts.
