Problem Statement:
Amazon is one of the biggest online shopping websites, and it collects a lot of data from the products it sells every day. But just having the data is not enough — we need to study it properly to find useful information. 
This project looks at Amazon’s sales data to understand things like which products are selling the most, which months have the highest sales, how much money is being made, and what patterns appear over time. 
By using tools like Python and graphs, we can help businesses make better decisions, improve their sales, and understand their customers better.
